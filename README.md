# ArchitectureGAN
Interior plan genesis with layout as input using Generative Adversarial Networks
## Configuration
1. Python 3.6

2. PyTorch 0.4.0

3. Visual Studio 2013

4. Qt 5.5.1

## Creating the dataset
1. Download the dataset from our paper homepage;

2. Create a directory named `dataset` under the root directory, and divide the dataset into
`dataset/train` and `dataset/val`;

3. Run `python write_pickle.py`, and this should create a new directory, `pickle`, under the root
directory.

## Training the models

We provide four training scripts: `train_living.py`, `train_continue.py`, `train_location.py`
and`train_wall.py` that you can find in the folder `Living`, `Continue`, `Location`, and `Wall`,
respectively. The neural networks are described in detail in our paper.

## Synth floor plans

1. Move the trained models into the folder `synth/trained_model`;
These trained models includes:
living_fc1_300.pth, living_resnet34_300.pth
continue_fc2_300.pth, continue_resnet34_300.pth
location_up1_100.pth, location_resnet34_100.pth
wall_up1_100.pth, wall_resnet34_100.pth

2. Now, navigate to `/synth`, and run `python synth.py`. The output floor plan is in the folder
`synth_output`.

## Vectorization

To vectorize the floor plans generated by our method, run `python vectorization.py`. This should
create a new directory, ` synth_vectorization`, under the root directory.
We also provide a GUI tool to visualize the vectorized floor plans.
